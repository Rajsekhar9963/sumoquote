1, First, create the virtual python environment by `python3 -m venv venv` and activate it by running `source venv/bin/activate`
2, Install pip using ` python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
3, Then install requirements ` pip install -r requirements.txt`
4, set PYTHONPATH to the test root repo ` export PYTHONPATH=$PWD `
5, Then run the tests by command `pytest`

Note: If using a windows machine replace `python3` with `py`
